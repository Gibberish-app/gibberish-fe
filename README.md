# Gibberish

## Where the words are made up but the points definitely matter.

#### Game Summary
Gibberish is a turn-based word game in which a player scores points by placing tiles onto a game board, forming nonsense words that _sound_ like English but aren't! Like a crossword, the tiles can be read left-to-right or top-to-bottom but must be touching in order to be a valid play. When there are no more tiles in the bag and one player has placed all of their remaining letters, scores are calculated and the player with the highest score wins!
